The album opens with "Midnite", a smooth and sultry track that sets the mood for the rest of the album. Braxton sings about a late-night rendezvous with her lover, over a laid-back groove and a saxophone solo. The next song, "Take This Ring", is a more upbeat and funky number, where Braxton asserts her independence and demands respect from her partner. She sings, "You want me to play wife/But you won't buy the ring/Boy you better get your life/Or I'm about to leave".
 
"What's Good" is a ballad that showcases Braxton's vocal range and emotional delivery. She sings about the dilemma of staying in a relationship that has lost its spark, over a piano and strings arrangement. She asks, "What's good about goodbye/When the best part of my life was you?". "Trippin (That's The Way Love Works)" is another ballad that explores the ups and downs of love. Braxton sings about how she and her lover keep hurting each other, but can't seem to let go. She sings, "We be trippin', flippin', fussin', fightin'/As bad as it gets we keep on comin' back for more/'Cause that's the way love works".
 
"Please" is a mid-tempo song that expresses Braxton's frustration with her lover's lack of commitment. She pleads with him to make up his mind and stop playing games with her heart. She sings, "Please don't leave me in love/Don't you do it boy/Don't you do it boy". "I Wanna Be (Your Baby)" is a tender and romantic song that shows Braxton's softer side. She sings about wanting to be close to her lover and share her feelings with him. She sings, "I wanna be your baby/Won't you be my man?/I wanna be your soldier/When you're too weak to stand".
 
"Sposed To Be" is a song that challenges the conventional expectations of love and marriage. Braxton sings about how she and her lover don't need to follow the rules or fit into a mold to be happy. She sings, "We don't need no license/We don't need no rings/We don't need nobody's blessings/It ain't what it seems". "Stupid" is a song that admits Braxton's mistakes in love and how she let her guard down for the wrong person. She sings, "I did everything for you/But I had to learn the hard way/Now I know you're not the one for me/You're just plain stupid".
 
"Shadowless" is a song that describes Braxton's loneliness and longing for her lover who has left her. She sings, "You took away the light/You left me in the dark/You left me with no choice but to stay here shadowless". The album closes with "Finally", a song that celebrates Braxton's liberation and happiness after finding true love. She sings, "Finally I can see/Beyond the clouds that rain on me/Finally I can breathe again/I'm free again".
